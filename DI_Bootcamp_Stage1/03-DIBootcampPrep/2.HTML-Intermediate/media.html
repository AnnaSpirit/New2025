            Maybe I'm foolish, maybe I'm blind
            Thinking I can see through this and see what's behind
            Got no way to prove it so maybe I'm blind
            
            But I'm only human after all, I'm only human after all
            Don't put your blame on me
            
            Take a look in the mirror and what do you see
            Do you see it clearer or are you deceived in what you believe
            
            Cos I'm only human after all, you're only human after all
            Don't put the blame on me
            Don't put your blame on me
            
            Some people got the real problems
            Some people out of luck
            Some people think I can solve them
            Lord heavens above
            I'm only human after all, I'm only human after all
            Don't put the blame on me
            Don't put the blame on me
            
            Don't ask my opinion, don't ask me to lie
            Then beg for forgiveness for making you cry, making you cry
            
            Cos I'm only human after all, I'm only human after all
            Don't put your blame on me, don't put the blame on me
            
            Some people got the real problems
            Some people out of luck
            Some people think I can solve them
            Lord heavens above
            I'm only human after all, I'm only human after all
            Don't put the blame on me
            Don't put the blame on me
            I'm only human I make mistakes
            I'm only human that's all it takes to put the blame on me
            Don't put your blame on me
            
            I'm no prophet or messiah
            Should go looking somewhere higher
            
            I'm only human after all, I'm only human after all
            Don't put the blame on me, don't put the blame on me
            I'm only human I do what I can
            I'm just a man, I do what I can
            Don't put the blame on me
            Don't put your blame on me"</pre>

            Is this the real life?
            Is this just fantasy?
            Caught in a landslide
            No escape from reality
            Open your eyes
            Look up to the skies and see
            I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy
            Because I'm easy come, easy go
            A little high, little low
            Anyway the wind blows, doesn't really matter to me, to me
            
            Mama, just killed a man
            Put a gun against his head
            Pulled my trigger, now he's dead
            Mama, life had just begun
            But now I've gone and thrown it all away
            Mama, ooo
            Didn't mean to make you cry
            If I'm not back again this time tomorrow
            Carry on, carry on, as if nothing really matters
            
            Too late, my time has come
            Sends shivers down my spine
            Body's aching all the time
            Goodbye everybody - I've got to go
            Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth
            Mama, ooo - (anyway the wind blows)
            I don't want to die
            I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all
            
            I see a little silhouetto of a man
            Scaramouch, scaramouch will you do the fandango
            Thunderbolt and lightning - very very frightening me
            Gallileo, Gallileo,
            Gallileo, Gallileo,
            Gallileo Figaro - magnifico
            
            But I'm just a poor boy and nobody loves me
            He's just a poor boy from a poor family
            Spare him his life from this monstrosity
            Easy come easy go - will you let me go
            Bismillah! No - we will not let you go - let him go
            Bismillah! We will not let you go - let him go
            Bismillah! We will not let you go - let me go
            Will not let you go - let me go (never)
            Never let you go - let me go
            Never let me go - ooo
            No, no, no, no, no, no, no -
            Oh mama mia, mama mia, mama mia let me go
            Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me
            for me
            for me
            
            So you think you can stone me and spit in my eye
            So you think you can love me and leave me to die
            Oh baby - can't do this to me baby
            Just gotta get out - just gotta get right outta here
            
            Ooh yeah, ooh yeah
            Nothing really matters
            Anyone can see
            Nothing really matters - nothing really matters to me
            
            Anyway the wind blows...</pre>
